The Records screen lists all records created in given sandbox environment due to a mylet testing:

![](/images/dev-portal-records.png)

There are two ways records appear here:
1. They are created manually using the portal by typing a text
2. They are created by developer's smart-phone MYLE app when it is set up in sandbox mode

In the both cases records are created to test mylets.
