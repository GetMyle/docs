Mylets can be executed in sandbox environment before going to market due to testing purposes.

To publish a mylet to sandbox environment it is enough to run it at least once, or to explicitly publish to sandbox on [the Mylet details screen](/mylet-details/fields).

Developers are able to connect MYLE App on their smart-phones by going to MYLE App settings and tapping on `Login to Sandbox` button. Once logged in there is an indicator in top right corner:

Now you can test the mylet as it is in production. Once ready you can publish to MYLE market.
