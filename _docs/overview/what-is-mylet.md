A mylet is a web app that is hosted somewhere in Internet and exposes HTTP end-points that MYLE back-end understands. There are two end-points supported:

 1. UI - required - is called to display mylet UI in a smart-phone or in a browser
 2. Hook - optional - is called when there is a new record associated with the mylet; the association is done by mylet key-phrases

Mylet developers register such apps in MYLE using [mylet development portal](/dev-portal/the-portal).

You can think of a mylet as of an app that transforms user's data into desired output. Users install mylets through [MYLE market](https://cloud.getmyle.com/market).
